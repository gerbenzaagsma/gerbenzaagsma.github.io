Hello and welcome. I am an Assistant Professor in Contemporary and Digital History at the [Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH)](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/) of the University of Luxemburg with research and teaching interests in modern Jewish, digital, public, and music history

Previously, I worked as a researcher at the Public History Research and Consultancy Center of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. I then studied Yiddish at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, before embarking upon my PhD research project at the the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. I then was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies, University College London and an editor, web developer & researcher at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands, Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Between 2013-2017, I worked as a research fellow in the project The diaries of Anne Frank. Research—Translations— Critical Edition at the Lichtenberg Kolleg, the Institute of Advanced Study at the University of Göttingen, where I was responsible for the annotations of a new critical scholarly edition of the diaries and conducted research on Jews in hiding in the Netherlands. 


I hold a Ph.D. in modern history from the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence. 


I joined the C²DH in August 2017 and was Head of the Research Area Digital History & Historiography until December 2020, when it merged with the center’s DHARPA team. 

On behalf of C²DH I also serve on the Ethics Review Panel (ERP) of the University of Luxembourg.
