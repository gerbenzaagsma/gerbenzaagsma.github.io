Welcome to the website of Gerben Zaagsma. I am an Assistant Professor in Contemporary and Digital History at the [Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH)](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/) of the University of Luxemburg. With a background in modern Jewish/Yiddish history, my current research and teaching is mostly in the fields of digital and public history, Holocaust and genocide studies, as well as music history.

Before joining C²DH in August 2017, I worked in a number of different places and settings, see my [CV](/cv/) for more information. You can also check my [talks](/talks) and list of [publications](/publications). Several recent papers and lectures can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?q=zaagsma&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest).


At the moment, my work revolves around three main areas (see the [research](/research) page for more details):
* the **history of digital history**;
* the **censorship of history online**;
* and **digital literacy for historians**.
